This sample consists on documenting how you could copy one Azure Web App to one slot by using PowerShell.

3 approaches are taken here, it's the opportunity to play with Powershell:

- [First approach - Clone web app](Clone-Approach.md) - Use the built-in Azure Web App Clone feature.
- [Second approach - Backup and Restore](Backup-Restore-Approach.md) - Use the built-in Azure Web App Backup and Restore feature.
- [Third approach: Copy files](Copy-Files-Approach.md) - Use the Azure Web App Backup feature but restoring sub-part of the files, in our case, just the `wwwroot` folder.

Hope that helps and let's adapt by yourself these 2 approaches for your own context, needs and setups!
